# Correlation-Project

Basic python analysis using kaggle movies.csv 

initial hypothesis : company is correlated to the gross and budget. 

1. i've used the movies.csv file from this link "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies?resource=download"
2. you can use the same csv or can downloade the latest/updated file. but the results will be a little bit different.
3. add your file path in df = pd.read_csv(""). to access the file.
4. any question feel free to contact. :)
5. enjoy. :)
